In this repository, I'm going to create a class-based component and also create our first state.

Instructions

Create a project using create-react-app.
Transform the App.js into a class-based component.
Implement a state for this class containing a Person ={ fullName,bio, imgSrc, profession} and a boolean shows.
Add a button that toggles the show state. When the show state is true, the person's profile will appear.
Create a field that shows the time interval since the last component was mounted using the component lifecycle.
Hint: use the setInterval method.
